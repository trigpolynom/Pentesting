Input/Output
  cout represents standard output 
  << tells the program to insert the data into the stream; since we use cout, it puts the data in the standard output stream. 
  endl inserts a 'new line character' and flushes the buffer (this ensures that the next output prints in the next line)
  similarly, we can use the cin function followed by >> in order to get user's input
  
  when the user inserts their value and presses enter, the return value goes into the buffer. 
  when we run the program, in order to keep the console opened, we need to clean this buffer with the first cin.ignore() statement and then witht the second cin.ignore() we can prevent the console from closing
  
  Iteration and Conditional Structures
    switch tests in order the value of an expression against a list of values
    Only the block of operations associated with the matching expression is executed. Note that the value must be an inter=ger or a constant
    break statement is a jump statement.
    When break is encountered in a switch, the execution "jumps" to the line of code following the switch statement
    Iteration statements, loops, allow a set of instructions to be executed repeatedly for a fixed number of times or until a certain condition is reached.
