OS Fingerprinting
  Fingerprinting tools send a series of specially crafted requests to the target host
  Then they examine evry bit in the responses, creating a signature of the host behavior
  Signature is compared against a database of known operating systems sugnatures
  This exploits differences in the network stack implementation
  During a pentest, one has to perfomr this reconnaissance step on every network node:
    routers, servers, firewalls, printers, hosts, and so on...
    
Port Scanning 
  Once network mapping is performed, we know which nodes, and associated os's, are active on the target network.
  process used to determine what TCP and UDP ports are open on target hosts.
  a daemon is  a piece of software running on a server to provide a given service.A daemon also listens on  a specific port
  TCP Port Scanner:
    client tries to connect to a closed port <==> client tries to contact a daemon that is not running or is running on another port
    The simpletst way to perform a port scan is trying to connect ot every port
    If the scanner receives an RST packet, then the port is closed
    1 --SYN--> 2 --SYN+ACK-->1--ACK-->2
    every TCP connect scan probe gets recorded in the daemon logs
    TCP SYN scans were invented to be stealthyu
    During a SYn scan, the scanner does not perform a full handshake it just sends a SYN packet
    As there is no real connection to the destination daemon, a SYN scan cannot be detected by looking at daemons logs
    version detection scan: sudo nmap -sV==> This type of scan mixes a TCP connect scan with some probes, which are used to detect what app is listening on a particular port
    You can specify your ports as a comma-separated list, or as a port interval
    The four most basic TCP ports (22,445,80,443) can be used as indicators of "live" hosts in the network
    tcpwrapped means that the TCP handshake was completed, but the remote host closed the connection without receiving any data
